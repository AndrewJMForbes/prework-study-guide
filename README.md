# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage is designed to help anyone and everyone who is, will, or has done or is going to tackle a coding bootcamp. This is an interactive tool that can grow into possibly one of the best reference tools available. With the options available through Github.com all users can and are invited to add any information to the page that is not available. The main objective is to help our fellow coders out in any and every way possible using the tools all of us possess.

## My Motivation 

Some people would ask what would motivate someone to do something like this. Well to put it simply the more knowledge we possess the greater we can be as a whole a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. With as much interaction as developing has between developers doesn't it sound amazing to think that we all possess the ability to have all the same knowledge at the click of a button. I just want anyone who might be where I am now to not stress out and to know that if you have a question it's probably easy to find an answer all you have to do is look or ask.

## Why I made it!

The reason I built this page was in order to help someone who is or will be in my shoes. This page is to help people out there to realize they are not alone while going through these types of programs. As long as you can get the basic terminology and techniques down you should have no problem adapting and overcoming any challange presented during this bootcamp.

## The problem I'm trying to solve

 This solves a huge problem when it comes to learning direction. What do i mean by learning direction? Anyone can get on Youtube.com and watch videos on how to do this and how to do that but if you aren't started off facing the right direction you'll just wander aimlessly never arriving at your destination. And don't get me wrong I am in no way saying you can't get on Youtube.com and learn things, but wouldn't it be nice to know what you needed to learn in the order you needed to learn it? So this page helps give you a roadmap in sorts to let you know where your starting points are and which direction you should head towards giving you multiple reference points along the way to know that you're still heading in the right direction. Any time you need to refer back to the page just know that someone else was there too and it's here to hopefully make things easier for future students.

## What I learned

Making this page really helped me with webpage structure using HTML, adding custom colors and modifications using Cascading Style Sheet(CSS), and how to make the page interactive for any and every user visiting it. I learned that it's good to be able to have a reference tool that can be easily accesible, and that there are endless possibilities when it comes to designing an interactive and aesthetically pleasing webpage that can help out people who are or were in my shoes.


## Installion

Here I will take you through the steps you would need in order to view and possibly edit my page to where you could help anyone who may come after you.

First- Make sure you have an internet browser of your choosing of course because that will allow you to view your code as you make it. It will also be your biggist learning tool.

Second- Download any code editor you prefer I would suggest Visual Studio code (VS code) you can find the link here: https://code.visualstudio.com/. VS code makes it easily accessible to download in app extensions such as the live server extension that lets you hit save and it instantly makes your changes to your webpage. Don't be afraid to browse what they have.

Third- Go to https://github.com/ and make an account this will let you save the code you've written to their database to where you and other developers can collaborate. Github also lets you edit without the fear of losing files or messing it up to where it's un-repaiable. Github also comes with a desktop version as well.

Fourth- I recommend Downloading GitBash it uses your computers CMD control to simplify uploading to github and helps you control your files without having to open up folder after folder just to find your work. You can find the download link here:  https://git-scm.com/downloads There is a download for macOS users as well as windows.

Fifth- They aren't installations but don't be afraid to use the any hyperlinks you can bookmark them for later reference.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.  Access any of the hyperlinks on the page they will take you to an array of sites referring to developing. I used quite a few of the links to understand a variety of things through this whole process and I hope they help you like they helped me. All of These links will be on the page for your convenience.
